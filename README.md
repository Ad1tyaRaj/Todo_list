 Project Overview:
A Python-based to-do list application with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). This application allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently. It supports functionalities such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, editing tasks, and deleting them. The UI is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, making task management straightforward and effective.

Main Window:
The main window of the to-do list application serves as the central hub for managing tasks. It displays a list of tasks, each with a checkbox to mark them as completed. The window includes buttons for adding new tasks, editing existing ones, and deleting tasks. A search bar at the top allows users to quickly find specific tasks. The overall layout is clean and uncluttered, focusing on usability and clarity.

Add/Edit Task Dialog:
The Add/Edit Task dialog is a popup window that appears when the user wants to add a new task or edit an existing one. It includes fields for entering the task name, description, due date, and priority level. The dialog also features save and cancel buttons, ensuring users can easily submit or discard their changes. The design is straightforward, with clearly labeled fields to guide users through the process.
